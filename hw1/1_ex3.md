###break at 0x7c00
bios passes its control to bootloader at 0x7c00. This is a fixed agreement for PC.  

```  
(gdb) b *0x7c00  
Breakpoint 1 at 0x7c00  
(gdb) c  
Continuing.  
The target architecture is assumed to be i8086  
[   0:7c00] => 0x7c00:	cli  


Breakpoint 1, 0x00007c00 in ?? ()  
(gdb)  
```  
we are now in bootloader  


###sanitizing
```  
0x7c00:  cli  
```  
stop interrupt  


```  
0x7c01:	cld  
```  
clear data flag  

```  
0x7c02:	xor    %ax,%ax  
0x7c04:	mov    %ax,%ds  
0x7c06:	mov    %ax,%es  
0x7c08:	mov    %ax,%ss  
```  
clear segment registers  


###enable A20  
```  
0x7c0a:	in     $0x64,%al  
0x7c0c:	test   $0x2,%al  
0x7c0e:	jne    0x7c0a  
```  
This is the "classical" way of enabling A20 (compared with fast A20, explained in [1_ex2.md](https://github.com/Philip-Li/6.828-MIT/blob/master/hw1/1_ex2.md))  

It pulls from port 0x64 (keyboard controller) until keyboard answers (because cpu and keyboard are two devices running in parallel). Keyboard saves its status in a status controller which can be read from port 0x64, where bit 0 is output buffer status (0: empty buffer, don't read; 1: readable) and bit 1 input buffer (0: empty, writable; 1: full, don't write)  
So _0x2(10b)_ means not writable and not readable aka. keyboard is busy  


For more information on keyboard controller, refer to [this](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-11.html) and [this](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/A20.html)


As for assembly commands, _test_ substracts two operands and sets _ZF_ to 0 if the difference is 0. _jne_ or _jnz_ (same thing, notice that source code uses jnz but compiler translates to jne) reads from _ZF_ to make a conditional jump.


For explaination of _jne_ and _jnz_, see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14267081/difference-between-je-jne-and-jz-jnz)
