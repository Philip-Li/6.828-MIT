##Step By Step Into BIOS


**[f000:fff0]    0xffff0:	ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b**  
current _cs_ is 0xf000 and _ip_ 0xfff0, which is 0xffff0 just 16 bytes from top (0xfffff)  
I'm not sure why it starts with 16 bytes from top, could be the jump instruction. As described in _Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual: Volume 2_

###prerequisite work  
**0xfe05b:   cmpl   $0x0,%cs:0x65b4**  
**0xfe062:   jne    0xfd3aa**  
not sure why jumps to 0xfd3aa. May need to look back later.


**0xfe066:   xor    %ax,%ax**  
clear _ax_


**0xfe068:   mov    %ax,%ss**  
clear _ss_. we are in real mode, so stack base is pointed by _ss:bp_ and top by _ss:sp_. In protected mode, however, stack base is _bp_ and offset is _sp_, so top is pointed by _bp:sp_


**0xfe06a:    mov    $0x7000,%esp**  
points _sp_ (stack top) to 0x7000 inside "low memory" (0x0 ~ 0xA0000)  
there is nothing there  
**(gdb) x/16x 0x7000**  
**0x7000:	    0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000**  
**0x7010:	    0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000**  
**0x7020:	    0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000**  
**0x7030:	    0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000** 


**0xfe070:	    mov    $0xf431f,%edx**  
**(gdb) x/16x 0xf431f**  
**0xf431f:    0x2cec8353	0x042444c7	0x000f6114	0x0f2404c7** 
**0xf432f:    0xe8000f5f	0xffffe0bd	0x000000bb	0x24448d40** 
**0xf433f:    0x24448918	0x24448d04	0x24048914	0x10244c8d**  
**0xf434f:    0x0c24548d	0x60e8d889	0x8bffffd6	0x89102444**
not sure why. May need to look later.


###jump to "real meat"  

**0xfe076:	    jmp    0xfd233**  
jump to the real meat


**0xfd233:	    mov    %eax,%ecx**  
clear _cx_


**0xfd236:	cli**  
stop interrupt


**0xfd237:	cld**  
clear data flag


**0xfd238:   mov    $0x8f,%eax**  
**0xfd23e:   out    %al,$0x70**  
output 0x8f to port 0x70.  
The instruction is 8-bit wide.  
The highest order bit is to enable/disable NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupts). NMI is for hardware failure and the other is for "watchdog" timer to detect kernel lockup. Source can be found [here](http://wiki.osdev.org/NMI).  
In this case, NMI is turned on (1000 1111). The remaining 7 bits are to address CMOS.


###select CMOS "register"  
port 0x70 is to select CMOS "registers" (legacy name). The general format is  
**_outb (0x70, (NMI_disable_bit << 7) | (selected CMOS register number))_**


This code selects register 0xf (1111). 0xf stores shutdown status. see [here](http://www.bioscentral.com/misc/cmosmap.htm) or [here](http://www.walshcomptech.com/ohlandl/config/cmos_registers.html)


###read/write CMOS "register"  
**0xfd240:     in     $0x71,%al**  
after selection, we can read/write through port 0x71 one byte a time. This code reads CMOS "register" 0xf to _al_

｀｀｀
(gdb) info registers  
eax            0x0	0
、、、
value 0 means "power on or soft reboot".


###test A20
｀｀｀
0xfd242:    in     $0x92,%al  
0xfd244:    or     $0x2,%al  
0xfd246:    out    %al,$0x92  
｀｀｀  
enables A20 line


###what is A20?  
A20 is a long story. Interested readers can find more fun (pain) [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20_line) and [here](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/A20.html).    

A20 is one of the most notorious hack in computer history. Originally, Intel's 8088 had only 1MB address space, so address space ranges from 0 to 1MB-1. If an address exceeds 1MB-1, for example, 1MB, it wraps around to 0.  

Dos programmers figured out a way to avoid loading segment register (too slow at that time) by exploiting this feature(design flaw). For example, one data segment is at 0xf800:0x0000, and the other is at 0x0000:0x8000. Instead of loading 0xf800 and 0x0000 when switching from one segment to the other, the second segment can be pointed at 0xf800:0x8000, which wraps around to 0x0. This is okay because there is no physical memory at 1MB any way.  

Then IBM came up with 80286, which supports up to 16MB RAM with real and protected modes. The purpose of real mode is to be compatiable with older programs. But Intel made a mistake (A BUG!!!), programs in real mode can acutally access address at 1MB (1 extra byte!!). As a result, those hacky programs (trying to avoid loading segment registers by wrapping from 1MB to 0) could no longer work.  

IBM decided to fix(hack) this on motherboard. So they used the unused pin from keyboard controller to be the status bit (enable/disable A20 line) and named it Gate-A20. Intially, the port was 0x64, but it was too slow. So lots of ports tried and finally settled on port 0x92 - the PS/2 port (that's what we see in the program). Using 0x92 is also called Fast A20 Gate.  

Enabling A20 also allows to access more than 1MB memory.
